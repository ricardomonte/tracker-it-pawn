# TRACKER-IT-PAWN

**TRACKER-IT-PAWN is a simple app where the users can keep track of how much they expend on their beloved dogs and how much time they invest with them. To be able to keep track of this, the user must first sign up or sign in. Once done, he will be redirected to the page where the user can add expenses and his dog(s). This project is built as the final project of Microvers. The main goal for this is to create an app application where you apply all that you learned during this time in Microvers. So for this project, this React-Redux application fetch the data from a Rails API application that I built.**
